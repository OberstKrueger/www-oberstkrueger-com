## The Origins of Aethmal and Seralin

The Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) genre stands singularly within my gaming hobby. No other genre offers a world that is immersive, persistent, and shared amongst a large playerbase, an environment that evolves over many years or even decades. The allure of the genre has led it to be the primary genre I spend my time with for the majority of my life.

One of the central elements of MMORPGs is in providing players with the ability to create distinctive personas to inhabit these expansive virtual worlds. The best games in the genre go beyond just having a detailed character creator, but providing tools for players to use their avatars a source of player-generated content. In such an environment, players can lose themselves in the world and their characters, allowing a role-playing environment to flourish in a manner that single-player games can not match.

While I seldom partake heavily in role-playing with others, I enjoy using these same tools to craft intricate backgrounds for my own characters, ideally tailored to each individual setting. Observing role-playing events as they happen around me enhances the immersion of the world, making it feel more like a real place and not just a digital facsimile of one.

Not every player approaches character creation in the same way. Some start from scratch with every new game, creating brand new avatars fresh from their imagination. Others maintain a catalog of diverse characters, rotating their use and altering them to fit the specifics of each new game. My own approach over the years has been to focus on two specific avatars, Aethmal and Seralin. These two have been my MMORPG alter egos for over 20 years, with each new game allowing me to create a new variation of their personas. To help enrich their backstories, a cast of supporting characters act as family and friends, promoting a depth and complexity to my gaming experience that would otherwise not be there.

## The Creation of Aethmal

After a few years of playing Multi-User Dungeons (MUD), the text-only precursor to MMORPGs, I purchased Asheron's Call, my first real MMORPG. My avatars in the various MUDs I played did not have any in-depth traits at all. Their names were variations of my real name, with no thought given to any sort of backstory. Once I started visiting different towns in the game's world, I noticed there were always people around role-playing, telling stories to each other or acting out various scenarios. The idea intrigued me, but I did not know precisely how to get involved. But it planted the idea of having a more in-depth background for my character, specifically creating something that would make sense for the world I am playing in.

Despite the bustling community within Asheron's Call, My experience was ultimately a lonely one. My MMORPG-playing friends were all playing another game: EverQuest.

EverQuest is an MMORPG inspired by the creations of J.R.R. Tolkein, with players able to create elves, orcs, goblins, and many other high fantasy species. The world contained many of the elements you would read about in The Lord of the Rings. When I discussed the game with them, one of the things that stuck out to me was the unique names each of them gave their characters. Some were references to real artists and musicians, or wordplay involving other fantasy characters, but a number of them were original creations not based on any other work. As my desire to play EverQuest increased, I began thinking about what sort of name I would use once I purchased the game. After writing many lists of possible names to find one that I liked the sound of, one name in particular stuck out to me: Aethmal.

## Adventures in Norrath

When I began my EverQuest journey, I knew I would use the name Aethmal. My initial time was characterized by frequently restarting with a new avatar, as I was still unsure about the character class I should commit to. My intent at this stage was not in creating a detailed persona, but rather just finding the class that appealed to me most. I had always held an affinity for elves in other fantasy worlds. Consequently, all of my early experimentations of Aethmal were various forms of elves. On February 21, 2001, I created the character that would be my long term representation in the game: Aethmal, the High Elf Paladin.

At the start, I had no backstory or personality in mind for Aethmal. As the game began to take hold of my life, I started contemplating his background. I finalized a basic and unpretentious story of how he became a Paladin for the city of Felwithe. One detail that I found compelling but did not develop further was Aethmal having a twin sister.

Although I initially had no interest in playing another character, I felt the need to create her within the game. This helped contextualize the character of Aethmal further. Given my role as a tank, it seemed fitting to design her in the same vein. Within EverQuest, Paladins are the only tank class that High Elves can be, forcing me to choose a different type of elf for her. The city of the Wood Elves was conveniently located near the city of the High Elves, an area to which I was particularly fond. Exactly one year and one week after creating Aethmal the High Elf Paladin, I introduced Seralin, the Wood Elf Warrior, to the world of EverQuest.

Over the next three years of gameplay, I gradually finalized the characters of Aethmal and Seralin. The visual designed established during these years have persisted over the two decades since. Aethmal's look both then and now is that of a white-haired elf in plate armor, wielding a two-handed sword, and exhibiting a touch of magical proficiency. Serain's image has likewise remained consistent, maintaining that of an auburn-haired elf in plate armor wielding dual longswords.

When EverQuest 2 neared release, I began a more comprehensive narrative for the two characters. With the 500-year timeline gap between the two games, I worked towards a transition for the characters that did not need to account for half a millennium of history. My time in the original EverQuest concluded with the Planes of Power expansion, which provided the perfect springboard to send the characters 500 years into the future. At the end of the Plane of Time, time itself is rewound by a few days. Instead of this explanation, I posited that time itself became chaotic, with different characters launched both into the past and far into the future. Aethmal and Seralin were among those thrust forward into the timeline for EverQuest 2.

In EverQuest 2, there are no restrictions preventing a race from being a particular class. Despite initial ideas of making Aethmal and Seralin Half-Elves, I adhered to their original High Elven heritage. Aethmal remained a High Elf Paladin and Seralin became a High Elf Ranger, uniting them together officially as High Elves.

## Adventures in Azeroth

Following my time with EverQuest and its sequel, I embarked on a multiyear journey in World of Warcraft. This transition presented an intriguing challenge: adapting the characters of Aethmal and Seralin to a new universe that necessitated considerable changes to their original designs. At launch, the race options that best fit were Night Elves and Humans. Night Elves, however, deviated too far from my mental image of the twins, and while Humans bore a closer resemblance, their non-elven nature felt like a regression from backgrounds I had previously fleshed out. Since Paladins were exclusive to Humans, I made the decision to depict both characters as Huamns. Nonetheless, these particular iterations did not resonate with me, leading me to continuously recreate Aethmal's character, transitioning him first into the role of Undead Warrior and then into a Night Elf Death Knight.

Sever years post-launch, I recreated both characters as Blood Elves, an alteration that finally brought me a deep sense of satisfaction in actualizing the characters. This form aligned with my initial visualization set forth in EverQuest, and also offered class roles that made sense. I devoted some time to levelin up Seralin before eventually taking a lengthy break from the game. Due to my sporadic engagement with the game, I couldn't find the opportunitiy to adapt Aethmal and Seralin's storyline to better fit the World of Warcraft universe, even though I had thought through several potential narratives.

## Adventures in the Lands Between

Although Aethmal and Seralin were conceived in 2001 and 2002 respectively, it wasn't until 2022 and the release of Elden Ring that I managed to craft incarnations of both characters that resonated deeply with me. This accomplishment can be credited to a unique feature in Elden Ring's character creator: the separation of face and body design. As dizygotic twins, the characters should exhibit a resemblance that is common amongst siblings, yet not be exact replicas of one another. Prior games presented wholly distinct models for male and female faces, which made achieving a familial resemblance difficult. Elden Ring enabled me to create a single face, apply it to both genders, and then fine-tune individual features to finally represent the characters as true siblings.

Due to the game encouraging a dual-wielding playstyle aligning closely with Seralin's nature, she was the first I brought to life. After a few attempts and one focused two-hour session on perfecting her face, I landed on a look that was a striking reflection of the image I held of her in my mind.

Aethmal's new form was created in a comparatively brief session. I began with Seralin's face, removed the hair, and then made minor adjustments to specific aspects of facial shape and muscular features. The end result was a character with the eyes and nose resembling Seralin's, with the jawline, chin, and mouth displaying more distinct differences. Despite Aethmal's full beard concealing some of these differences, the final look satisfied my expectations. After two decades of experimentation, Aethmal and Seralin truly appeared as the twins they were meant to be.

Elden Ring provides the ability to easily alter a character's look, a feature I frequently utilized during my extensive three hundred hours of play. While Seralin was my main build in the game, I also enjoyed substantial playtime as Aethmal. The looks established Elden Ring are now the reference models I will use for future versions of both characters.

## Returning to Azeroth

Elden Ring not only provided a design I was satisified with for both Aethmal and Seralin, but it also rekindled my motivation to further developer the history of the characters. With established physical attributes and more rigidly defined fighting styles in place, I started exploring potential avenues for their evolution. Around the same time Elden Ring launched, I viewed World of Warcraft Classic as a potential platform to revisit Azeroth, this time with a stronger focus on role-playing.

I introduced the twins into the game as Blood Elves, as I had earlier concluded this was the race that provided the best fit for them. Aethmal was again a Paladin and Seralin was a Hunter. Although I enjoyed diving back into the nostalgic charm of old-school World of Warcraft, the character designs no longer aligned with how my vision had evolved. Aethmal had recently veered towards darker magic, while Seralin had given up using a bow to exclusively come a dual-wielding swordmaiden. Despite the discrepancy, my fascination with Azeroth resurfaced. I yearned to continue my journey there.

Modern World of Warcraft had been kept out of my sights for six years. Although the Legion expansion provided a satisfactory experience upon its release, the storytelling capability of Blizzard had long since been declining. My original intention was to steer clear of modern servers and play exclusively on World of Warcraft Classic, but curiosity led me to check out the current state of the game. My attention was immediately captured by a new feature in the game: Allied Races. These offered alternate forms of existing races. In particular, the Void Elves stood out to me as an enticing option. In the game's lore, Void Elves are Blood Elves who have embraced the power of the void, introducing a darker undertone. Alleria Windrunner, the leader of the Void Elves, is a character that had always intrigued me, giving me more interest in the race.

Over a period of several months, I dabbled with the character creator and delved deep into the lore surrounding the inception of the Void Elves. What finally sealed my return to the modern servers was reading about gameplay changes that were forthcoming with the Dragonflight expansion. In particular, the reintroduction of a talent system excited me, as its prior removal was one of my major criticisms of the game.

Crucially, Void Elves offered class options that more accurately aligned with my then current version for the characters. For many years, I've nurtured a basic framework for a novel in my mind, where Aethmal uses ice magic and Seralin wields fire magic. In transposing this to World of Warcraft, a Frost Death Knight was an almsot perfect match for Aethmal. Seralin's adaptation was not as straightforward, as the game lacks a melee class with a fire theme. However, considering her origins and her non-reliance on heavy magic usage, I found this acceptable. Consequently, a Fury Warrior provided the closest match. This also provided the bonus that I had extensively experience playing as a Warrior during my original run in the game.

After immersing myself with these new character iterations for a few months, I knew I had hit the mark. The Void Elf race provided an ideal background and the required visual customization for both Aethmal and Seralin. Soon after establishing both characters, I joined a role-playing guild which further stimulated me to expand with a more thorough background. This endeavor subsequently reignited my ambition to write a comprehensive novel set in an original universe of my own making, with this current iteration of the characters serving as inspiration for the direction of the novel's protagonists.
