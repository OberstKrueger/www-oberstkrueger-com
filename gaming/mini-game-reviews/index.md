## Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

The first beta of the original Counter-Strike was released back in 1999. I did not play this first version, instead hopping in a few betas later. The original Counter-Strike is a great game, and was a core game that I played throughout most of high school years and into college.

What impresses me the most about Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is that it is the 3rd major iteration of the game, and it sticks to the formula that made the beta versions of the original Half-Life mod so successful. The game has experienced technological upgrades, but the core gameplay loop is the same was it was 20 years ago. Unlike other game series, the technology around the game modernizes while the gameplay itself is still the same.

This is emphasized by looking at the game's most popular map: de_dust2. The original de_dust2 was released in 2001, and quickly became a mainstay on servers. It is a well-balanced map that has not needed any major gameplay tweaks since the original version. In Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Source, there were servers dedicated to playing the map 24/7. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive honors this by having a map group dedicated to solely playing de_dust2, giving the same functionality.

Counter-Strike is a game that I still enjoy, although I am nowhere near as good as I was back in high school. But it is still fun to play, and something I see myself going back to every so often just to experience it again. Valve's stewardship of the Counter-Strike series is impressive, and I hope that they continue to not make any fundamental changes to the series as a whole. Counter-Strike could easily remain one of the main games that everyone will have played decades into the future, if Valve continues to treat it as it currently does.

## Quake Champions

The Quake series has always been one of my favorite series of games. Quake 1 and 2 are masterful singleplayer experiences, and Quake 3: Arena is the first PC game that I upgraded my graphics card for. With this background, I was looking forward to playing Quake Champions, despite some reticence over the decision for heroes to have timed special abilities.

The game hits the mark when it comes to fast-paced deathmatch. Quake 3 is one of the faster deathmatch games out there, and Quake Champions is close to it in speed. It feels like a proper Quake game with gorgeous gothic graphics and a wonderful industrial soundtrack by Chris Vrenna and Andrew Hulshult, while still modernizing with new mechanics such as character customization. Despite the hardcore competitive nature of the game, the overall community is positive. There was little trashtalk and immaturity during my time playing it.

Quake Champions is not without flaws. The game's art direction is perfect for a Quake game, but the engine does not hold up to the technical brilliance of previous entries. Performance slow downs and netcode hiccups are a regular occurrence. It is the first Quake game to not use an Id Tech engine, and it shows. Despite Doom having support for Vulkan, the developers have stated that Vulkan will not be coming to Quake Champions. It is also hard to get past the issue of lootboxes in the game. There is an option to purchase the game with all current and future characters unlocked, but all of the customization options come from loot boxes. These can be earned easily while playing, but between duplicates and the sheer amount of items available, it is likely specific looks for characters will need to be purchased for real cash. Unlock Overwatch and other similar games, individual items can not be unlocked with an in-game currency.

Unseating Quake 3: Arena as the king of arena shooters is a difficult task, and Quake Champions does not do that. Still, it is a solid entry into the Quake series and I am happy to have spent time playing it. As of this writing, the game is still in beta, and features are added regularly. The one feature that I miss from the game that will hopefully be added in the future is a Capture The Flag mode. This was my favorite mode to play in Quake 3, and I would love to play it again here.

## Subnautica

This is a game that surpassed my expectations in every way possible. Before Subnautica, the closest thing to a survival game that I played was Metal Gear Solid 3, which was more stealth-action with some light survival elements. The idea of having to "waste time" gathering resources to eat and heal took away from the action, which was more to my liking. The main reason I decided to give Subnautica a chance at all was due to Unknown Worlds Entertainment creating it. They created Natural Selection, one of my all-time favorite online games, so knowing the quality they are capable of pushed me to purchase the game and give it a shot.

What is most striking about the game to me is the art direction of it. Subnautica is a gorgeous game. I often found myself just idling about, enjoying the scenery. Many times I would sit on the top of my escape pod and just watch the sun and then rise again. All of the underwater caves have a unique feel to them that reward exploration. The abandoned bases that you come across are eerie and really feel like something that was built by another person. Sounds plays an important part in the game. As would be expected for a game focused on underwater locales, there are many areas that are nearly pitch black, requiring the use of sound for successfully navigate or to warn of incoming danger. The music adds to the overall ambiance of the game, with a soundtrack that is enjoyable to listen to both in and out of the game.

Subnautica does a great job of giving hints of the way forward without ever forcing you to do so. The world is open to exploration at the player's leisure. The one catch to this is that resources in the game do no respawn. A part of the ocean can be over-fished, or mineral resources tapped completely. This pushes the player to try and live more sustainably, or to go to further depths to explore. There are a lot of options available, all equally right in how you want to approach accomplishing your goal.

Unknown Worlds Entertainment created an amazing experience in this game. By the end, I was happy to have explored the game so thoroughly, but sad that it was ending. I know it will be hard game to go back and play again, as much of the mystery will be gone. But the memories I gained through my first playthrough are still vivid in my mind, even months after playing. No other game has had exploration that felt as rewarding as this one, nor created a world that will stick in my mind for a long time to come.

## What Remains of Edith Finch

What Remains of Edith Finch is the best narrative walking simulator that I have played.

The game is structured as a series of short stories. Each one is about the life and fate of a member of the Finch family. Some of the stories are told in a straight-forward manner, but some are told in a more unique manner. For example, Barbara Finches story is told like an old 1950s horror comic, with the camera moving between comic panes. This is fitting for her character, as she was renowned for screaming in a horror movie, and her death involved an unsolved home invasion, making it ripe for mimicking the style of a *Tales from the Crypt*-styled comic.

What separates this game from others is its visual acumen. The game is the most visually appealing walking simulator that I have played, with a wide range of graphical styles present. From the realistic visuals of the house, to the comic styles of Barbara's story, to the imaginary dream world of Lewis' story, there is much to enjoy in this department. Additionally, Jeff Russo does an amazing job with creating a soundtrack that fits the overall theme of the stories being told.

Like most games in this genre, it is short. The whole game can be experienced in about 2 hours total, and it is best played through in one sitting.
