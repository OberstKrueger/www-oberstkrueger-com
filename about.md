Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

This site has existed in many forms over the years, starting out as a simple blog built with [Ghost](https://ghost.org), turning into a larger website that I thought of as an online book, and now back in a slightly more minimal form.

This current iteration is influenced by the idea of a *digital garden*, which is the concept of having a website with articles but not structured like a blog. The articles are evergreen, and can go back and be updated as time goes on. It does not preclude a more blog-like section for updates or other uses, but that is not the focus of the website. The previous version of this site, The Krueger Report, was similar in concept, but what I wrote was still more blog-like. The pages did not fit well with being more long-standing ideas to be updated as time went on and more information was learned. This is the main idea idea I am aiming to correct.

Additionally, this site now exists as the main hub for my online presence. Everything else is both linked to by this site as well as linking back to it. All of my main online accounts will have this two-way street, making verification of who I am easier.
